/* What is TypeScript ?

TypeScript is an Object Orianted Programming Language
build on top of JavaScript with extra features.



To Use TypeScrit we have to make a file ts .. and then write our typeScript code and then we can 
give command to terminal tsc and then it will convert it into a js file..


but to edit the directory we have to open the TS congif file.. 
to open the config file we have to give a command call tsc --init

then in the tscongif.json file we have to find roodDir to define the directory of the ts file

we can define our ts file directory there ..

after that to define the compiled js file directory we will find outDir and by editning it we 
can define the directory of the js file .. 

to change the version of the js file we have to find target file and we can change the version
